<p>Economists, like all academics, often need to publish their work in journals. But particularly when early in your career, it’s not always obvious what journal would be a good fit for your paper, and scouring through recent papers in a large number of journals to find out is very time-consuming. This web app is meant to help here. It uses data from arXiv to match your paper with a suitable journal based on the similarity of your abstract with already published papers.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Currently, the web app is based on a relatively small data set of about 500 abstracts in English from over 300 journals in economics, all drawn from arXiv. arXiv was chosen because they have a good API that makes it fairly easy to collect abstracts in bulk. The ambition is for later versions of the app to work off of a much larger data set and on abstracts drawn from more academic disciplines.</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p>The app uses cosine similarity to measure the similarity between your abstract and each of the abstracts in the data set. Cosine similarity is a well-established measure for text similarity. How does it work? Any quantitative analysis of texts needs to convert a text to a set of numbers. This process is known as “vectorisation”, since the resulting set of numbers for any given texts represents a vector in an n-dimensional vector space. Cosine similarity corresponds to the cosine of the angle between two such vectors. A cosine of 0 represents two vectors that are at 90 degrees to one another and as such orthogonal or unrelated. The closer cosine gets to 1 the smaller the angle and greater the match. The cosine similarity score returned for a journal by the app is the average score for each abstract in that journal.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>The size of the data set is an obvious limitation. Relatedly, as should be obvious from the fact that the data set contains about 500 abstracts from over 300 journals, some journals are represented by a small number of abstracts, in some cases as few as one. The app’s “recommendations” should be taken with these facts in mind.</p>
